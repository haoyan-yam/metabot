   * Why a separate method (not just sendCard with pendingQuestion):
   *   - On Feishu, Card Schema 2.0 has a mobile-App render bug — `tag: action`
   *     button blocks are silently dropped on iOS/Android, so AskUserQuestion
   *     options become invisible. The Feishu adapter forces Schema 1.0 for
   *     question cards (v1 buttons are verified working on mobile).
   *   - On Telegram (and future platforms), this is the natural hook for
   *     inline-keyboard rendering — also conceptually distinct from a
   *     streaming "thinking" card.
   *
   * Optional: platforms without a special path may omit; bridge falls back
   * to sendCard / updateCard.
   *
   * See memory: bug-feishu-v2-mobile-action-buttons.
